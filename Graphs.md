**Graphs and Distributions**
Data can be represented using graphs and there are several types of graphs to choose from.Some of the most common graphs used in statistics are-
1. Bar graph
2.Pie chart
3.Dot plot
4.Histogram
5.Stem and leaf plot
6.Box plot
7.Cumulative Frequency plot

How to create these graphs and which graph would be suitable for our data??
*we can create graphs by hand, by using rstudio or by excel etc.*
Example-
Before we begin creating graph, its best to sort the data list.

-A **dot plot** is made simply by putting dots over the values listed in the number line.

-A **stem and leaf plot**, data is arranged by values.The digits in the largest place are referred to as STEM and digits at the smallest place are referred to as leaves. The leaves are displayed to the right of the stem.A split stem plot divides up the stem in to equal groups. Back to Back stem plots can be used to compare 2 sets of data.

- **Histograms** are created by first dividing data in to classes, or bins of equal width. Next count the observations in each class. The horizontal axis represents the variable values and the vertical axis represents your frequency or relative frequency.

-**BoxPlot** not only helps us identify features about our data quickly (such as spread and location of center) but also can be very helpful when comparing with datasets.

-**Cumulative Frequency Plot** of the percentages(also called an ogive) can be used to view the total number of events that occurred upto a certain value.
2 ways- 1 is normal and 1 by calculating percentage(divide each freq by num of values and then multiply by 100)

-**Bargraph and piecharts** are best used with categorical data.
A bar graph is created by listing the categorical data in x-axis and frequencies along the y-axis. Bars are drawn above each data value.

A pie chart is a circular chart divided in to sectors indicating the proportion of each data value compared to each set of values.
![Example](/images/piech.png?raw=true "Example")

We are also concerned about the pattern and shapes of graph that our data represents-
1. Uniformity
2. Symmetry
3. Bimodal - more than one mode
4. Bell shaped
5. Skewed to right (tail towards right)
6. skewed to left (tail towards left)
