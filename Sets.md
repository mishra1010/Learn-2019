**Sets and Venn Diagrams**
-A set is a collection of objects.2 sets are equal if they contain the same set of elements.
-Set A is a subset of Set B if all elements of Set A is in Set B. The notation for this is A ⊆  B. Set A is a proper subset of Set B if very element preset in Set A is present in Set B and there is atleast one element in Set B that is not in Set A. The notation for this is A⊂B
- The union of A and B, which is A U B, is the set of all elements that belong to either Set A or Set B (or that belong to both Set A and B)

- The intersection of A and B, which is A ∩ B, is the set of elements that belong to both Set A and Set B.
- if the intersection of 2 sets is empty (A ∩ B), the empty set is denoted by ∅. The sets are disjoint or mutually exclusive.
- The complement of set A is the set of all elements that are in the universal set but not there in Set A.
