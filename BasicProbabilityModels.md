**Basic Probability Models**

The probability of any outcome of a random phenomenon is the proportion of times the outcome would occur in a long series of repititions.
- The sample space of a random phenomenon is the set of all possible outcomes.
- An even is an outcome or set of outcomes of a random phenomenon.It is a subset of the sample space. A simple event is an event consisting of exactly one outcome.
- To compute the probability of some event E occurring, divide the number of ways that E can occur by the number of possible outcomes, the sample space,S, can occur: P(E)=n(E)/n(S)

*Basic Rules of Probability*
1. All events have a probability between 0 and 1. 0<=P(E)<=1
2. All possible outcomes together must have a probability of 1. P(S)=1
3. *Complement Rule* P(E^c)=1-P(E)
4. *Addition Rule* if E and F are disjoint events, then P(E U F)=P(E)+P(F). ### In this case P(E ∩  F) is empty or 0.
5. If E and F are any events of an experiment, then P(E U F)=P(E)+P(F)-P(E ∩  F)
