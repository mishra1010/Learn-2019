**Counting Techniques**
Combinatorics is the study of the number of ways a set of objects can be arranged,combined,or chosen, or number of ways a succession of events can occur.
Each result is an **outcome**.
An **event** is a subset of outcomes.
When several events occir together, we have a **Compound event**.

The **Fundamental counting principle** states that the total number of ways a compound event may occur is n1,n2....ni where n1 represents the number of ways first event may occur, and so on.

**A permutation** of a set of n objects is an ordered arrangement of the objects. Keyword for permutations is that it is an arrangement.

*When we allow repeated values, the number of orderings of n objects taken r at a time, with repetition is n^r.
