**General probability Rules**

Two events are independent if knowing that one occurs does not change the probability that the other occurs.
(Note: This is not the same as sets that are disjoint or mutually exclusive)

.. If E and F are independent events then
P(E ∩ F) = P(E)*P(F)

*Dependent Events*
The occurence of one event does have an effect on the occurence of the other event.
-The probability P(E|F) is read "the probability of event E given that F had already occurred"
-If E and F are independent, then P(E|F)=P(E)
- if events E and F are dependent then P(E|F) = P(E ∩ F)/P(F) --- so here the event that is given is F.
- The above means P(E ∩ F) = P(E|F)*P(F)
