**Range,IQR and Outliers**

In this section we will discuss more on the measures of spread or dispersion of data.
-Range : max-min- It is the difference between the maximum vaue and minimum value in the list.

-Percentiles : when our list is in order, we can find percentiles. The most common ones are
.25th percentile(Q1)
.50th percentile(Q2 or median)
.75th percentile(Q3)

-IQR : stands for Inter Quartile Range and it is found by subtracting Q3-Q1

...The values of the minimum Q1,Q2,Q3 and the maximum make up what is called our 5 number summary.If we are given the 5 number summary, we 
can quickly find the range and IQR.
